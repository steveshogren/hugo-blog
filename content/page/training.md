### Myth: I Need a Degree/Six Months of Bootcamp

Anyone with desire and drive can learn to program in their spare time. You can
get a full-time programming job without any schooling or credentials. All you
you need is hard work, practice, and some basic guidance!

### Myth: I Need Expensive Books/Software

I have trained many people from zero to full-time programmers. We only used free
resources to teach them everything they needed. They used free tools like
Notepad++, Vim, Intellij Community, and Visual Studio Express.

### Myth: I Need a Fancy New Computer

You can learn everything you need with just an old computer and the internet! If
it can reliably run notepad and a web browser, it will do just fine. I have been
a professional developer for almost a decade, and I learned much of what I know
on an old Acer Aspire One netbook. It barely ran three tabs on Chrome, but it
got the job done!

### Myth: I Need to Pick the Right Language Now!

The first language you learn should not be your last! Ideally, you should learn
two or three languages before getting your first job. Something about switching
languages is very effective for training developers. Having a few under your
belt gives you a breadth of understanding that helps you learn new concepts
faster.

## The Course:

* Step 1 - Basic Syntax

    Several fantastic resources exist for getting the basics of programming
    language syntax. I recommend at least one of the following, preferably both:
    * [CodeAcademy Javascript module](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
    * [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

* Step 2 - Basic Tools

    After completing Step 1, you need to invest in some valuable tooling to make
    your learning faster. You should learn how to do something called Test
    Driven Development. 
    
    * [Learn Test Driven Development](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)
    * [Kata - the Only Way to learn TDD](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/)

* Step 2 - Basic Semantics

    After completing Step 1, you need to invest in some foundational concepts.
    These are a little slower, but incredibly valuable. We recommend reading and
    completing the exercises of the first three chapters of the excellent
    introductory book
    [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
