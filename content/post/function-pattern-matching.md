Pattern matching is a simple tool that will make your code safer and
easier to read.

Consider the following code that converts an Int to a string.

``` csharp
public enum Language {
    Spanish,
    English
}
public static string convert(int number, Language lang) {
    string ret = "";
    if (lang == Language.English) {
        switch(number) {
            case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
            case 1: ret = "one"; break;
            default: ret = "..."; break;
        }
    } else if (lang == Language.Spanish) {
        switch(number) {
            case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
            case 1: ret = "uno"; break;
            default: ret = "~~~"; break;
        }
    }
    return ret;
}
```

What happens when we make this simple change?

``` csharp
public enum Language {
    Spanish,
    English,
    German
}
``` 

Does the code still compile? Sure does! Does the compiler/IDE offer us
any indication that something is missing? Nope! Our code has a
potential bug that is only exposed at run-time, and nothing will tell
us that. We made it fail gracefully by ensuring our code always
returns at least an empty string, but we have created a bug that can
only really be caught by something external: either automated tests or
manual checking.

The OO purists and "Anti-If" guys are probably leaping out of their
seats. "Use classes and an interface!" they yell. Ok, sure. I assert
that it just makes things even worse.


``` csharp
public interface ILanguage {
    String convert(int num);
}
public class Spanish : ILanguage {
    public String convert (int num) {
        var ret = "";
        switch (num) {
            case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
            case 1: ret = "uno"; break;
            default: ret = "~~~"; break;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
public class English : ILanguage {
    public String convert (int num) {
        var ret = "";
        switch (num) {
            case 0: ret = "zero"; break;
            case 1: ret = "one"; break;
            default: ret = "..."; break;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
// somewhere else...
public static string convert(int x, Language lang) {
    return getLanguage(lang).convert(x);
}
public static ILanguage getLanguage(Language lang) {
    switch (lang) {
        case Language.English: return new English() ; break;
        case Language.Spanish: return new Spanish() ; break;
        default: throw new Exception();
    }
}
``` 

We have turned 21 lines in one file into 36 in three files (not
counting namespaces and imports). Does this new structure give us any
additional safety when we add a new concrete implementation? How about
when we add a new enum value? This code is even more likely to cause
bugs than the first, because now we have an implicit coupling between
the enum and the concrete class. We could get rid of the enum, and
"pass in concrete class" but _something_ still has to say which
concrete class to instantiate.

Imagine if the compiler could warn us when either the enum or the
class changed. Imagine if instead of having to hunt down the possible
uses, we could just compile and fix the errors.

Good news, we can!

Check out this F# code. If you have never seen F# before, I know, it
looks completely crazy! It _still_ looks a little weird to me, but
just try to read it. I think you will surprise yourself. This is a
function called `convert`, and if you keep in mind that the types
always come AFTER the value, the code makes a lot more sense. A
parameter in C# would be `int number`; in F# it is written
`number:Int`. Don't ask me why. The `match number with` is just how
you do the equivalent to a `switch/case` in C#, but you will see in a
second it is a lot more powerful!

``` fsharp
let convert(number:Int, lang:Language) :string =
    match lang with
        | Language.English -> 
            match number with
               | 1 -> "one" 
               | 2 -> "two" 
               | _ -> "..."
``` 

We are using the same enum from the C# file, but it is missing
something, right? Where are the Spanish and German parts? I try to
compile this and what do I see?

` ~/Program.fs(11,11): Warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern
matches on this expression. For example, the value 'enum<Language>
(0)' may indicate a case not covered by the pattern(s). (FS0025) `

Spittake mushroom soup, the compiler just caught a potential bug for
us! A C# run-time bug no less! Not only is this very powerful, but it
is so simple. I can code the way I normally do, only now I get
additional safety for free! And no unit or integration test would ever
catch this class of errors. 

Heck, if you really want to keep your classes and interfaces in C#,
you can have some "glue code" in F#, and still get all the benefit!

``` fsharp
let convert(number, lang) =
    match lang with
        | Language.English -> English().convert(number)
```

This still calls the C# class above, and now the compiler gives us a
warning when we add a new enum value!

In this way, pattern matching is able to clearly remove edge cases. We
converted an unsafe `if` and `switch` statement into a type safe
`match`.

BONUS ROUND!

What we have already seen of pattern matching makes it a better
`switch/case` but what about the `if` statement? Thankfully the
`match/with` statement allows for patterns matched to have a `when`
clause which only matches when the condition is true:

``` fsharp
let convert(number, lang) =
    match lang with
        | Language.English -> 
            match number with 
                | x when x > 5 -> "Large!"
                | 0 -> "zero"
        | Language.Spanish -> 
            match number with 
                | x when x > 5 -> "Grande!"
                | 0 -> "zero"
``` 

Running the compiler again give us:

` /home/jack/programming/monads-fsharp/monads-fsharp/Program.fs(19,19):
Warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. For
example, the value '1' may indicate a case not covered by the
pattern(s). However, a pattern rule with a 'when' clause might
successfully match this value. (FS0025) (monads-fsharp) `

That's right, it checks numbers too.

Lastly, it is possible to match on a combination of values, all at
once. We can convert our more complex structure to something simpler
using this trick, and the compiler is still intelligent enough to
check for missing cases.

``` fsharp
let convert(number, lang) =
    match lang, number with
        | Language.English, 0 -> "zero" 
        | Language.English, 1 -> "one"
        | Language.English, x when x > 1 -> "Larger than one!"
        | Language.English, _ -> "dunno"
        | Language.Spanish, 0 -> "zero" 
        | Language.Spanish, x when x > 5 -> "Grande!"
``` 

Here we introduce the `_` which is equivalent to a `default` in a C#
`switch/case` statement. The pattern `Language.English, _ ->` sets a
default for any number in `Language.English` not already matched. The
bug in the code here is the missing `Language.Spanish` with numbers
1-5. What does the compiler say?

`Program.fs(11,11): Warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this
expression. For example, the value '(_,1)' may indicate a case not
covered by the pattern(s). However, a pattern rule with a 'when'
clause might successfully match this value. (FS0025) (monads-fsharp)`

Lastly, let's show the final result of converting our original
function to F#. If your entire function is just a single pattern
match, you can remove the `match/with` line and use the `function`
keyword, and simply match against the parameters (which I reversed for
clarity, but do not need to be written).

```fsharp
let convert = function
    | Language.English, 0 -> "zero" 
    | Language.English, 1 -> "one"
    | Language.English, _ -> "..."
    | Language.Spanish, 0 -> "zero" 
    | Language.Spanish, 1 -> "uno" 
    | Language.Spanish, _ -> "~~~"
```

Our original 17 line convert function, converted into a _safer_ 7
lines! I never had to specify what the types of lang, number and the
return type are, because the compiler is able to figure that out from
the code I wrote.

If you are not convinced at this point that pattern matching is a big
step forward in the safety and ease of development, I am not sure what
else would convince you. More safety means less time spent tracking
down bugs and more time adding on features!
