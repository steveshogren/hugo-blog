My friends and I used to play DOTA 1, back when it was just a Warcraft 3 mod.
We'd play for hours, trying all the different characters and items. Fast forward
to my current game: Paragon.

/*
Unlike most MOBA's, you build a deck of cards before the match starts. Instead
of an item shop, you pick a deck at the beginning of a match to play. When you
go back to base you can only buy cards from your deck. Like a Collectible Card
Game, all cards have a color, and you can only build a deck from two colors.
