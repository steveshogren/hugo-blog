I previously discussed how my team has a decade of experience with
[self-organizing teams](/self-organizing-teams/) and
[pair programming](/pairprogramming/) to reduce wasted productivity in an
Enterprise banking application.

We have several practices to help remove obstacles that stand in the way of
producing business value:

+ Full-time pair programming on all production code
+ Any pair can make any technical decision
+ Pairs switch twice a day
+ Strong unit-testing culture
+ Bugs and broken CI builds are the top priority

These foundational practices eliminate the need for a technical lead who assigns
and follows up on work. No work is assigned to any individual. If a pair has
nothing to do, there is a priority queue of features and technical debt close at
hand.




I've seen that concept a lot lately as I've read more about healthy
self-organizing teams. Trust should always be given, but a good way to produce
accountability is through openness and "sharing" like that. Recently I've come
to realize that really the practice of stand-ups has a great knock on benefit of
that: pairs aren't assigned work and not really "checked up on", but the sharing
and openness of the stand-up helps give accountability to the group.
