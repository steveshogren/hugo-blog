My team has a decade of experience applying
[self-organizing teams](/self-organizing-teams/) and
[pair programming](/pairprogramming/) to reduce wasted productivity in an
enterprise banking application.

We currently apply several democratically-elected practices to help remove
obstacles:

+ Full-time pair programming on all production code
+ No work is assigned to an individual or pair
+ Any pair can make any technical decision
+ Pairs switch randomly twice a day
+ Five minute status update ("stand-up") twice a day
+ Weekly "retrospective" to reflect and make changes
+ Weekly half-day research time to sharpen your skills

### No Technical Lead

These foundational practices eliminate the need for a technical lead who assigns
and follows up on work. No work is assigned to any individual. If a pair has
nothing to do, there is a priority queue of features and technical debt close at
hand. 

If a pair makes a technical decision that isn't ideal, the next pair will have
the opportunity to choose to continue down that path or adjust the code to a
better solution. To prevent significant rework, we meet once a week for under an
hour to chat about the upcoming week's features and get a rough idea of the
direction we want to go.

### No Pull Requests

Pairing and pair rotation eliminates the need for an asynchronous code review
and a pull request process. Any pair can make any decision, so code review
happens 100% of the time. A single feature is usually seen by three to five
developers as they rotate through the pairs.

### How does this work?

As amazing as it all sounds, what prevents this process from falling into
anarchy? How has this been working for us for over ten years with very little
oversight? The team has completely changed three times (roughly a 3.6 year
average turnaround) so it can't only be about "the right people".

### Self-Correction While Maintaining Trust

The author of
[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) talks
about the "self-correction" that allows self-organizing teams to adapt without
putting a thick rule-book of policies into place and revoking trust. Instead of
adding new policies when trust is abused, these "teal" organizations build a
simple system that self-corrects.

The author suggests that three things are needed for self-correcting teams:

1. A shared understanding of whatâ€™s healthy
2. Information
3. A forum for conversation to trigger self-corrective action

Our process has several examples of self-correction, and several places we are
still sorting out how to best self-correct.

### Example: Any pair can make any technical decision

Consider the practice that "any pair can make any technical decision." The
**information** comes when the pairs switch every half-day. Zack and Sally might
think architecting the module one way is a good idea in the morning, but Sally
and Jane might not see it the same way in the afternoon. The information spreads
organically every four hours as a fresh set of eyes gets to see the work. The
**forum for self-corrective action** happens when the new person sits to see the
work and they discuss the previous session's decisions.

In practice, rework happens only occasionally as everyone strives to produce the
best designs they can. No one wants to see their work undone because of a missed
requirement or poor design, which prompts a healthy desire to do one's best.

### Example: Work Isn't Assigned

Work isn't assigned to pairs or individuals. The **shared understanding** is
that the most valuable thing for the business is for pairs to work on the
priority queue of enhancements or technical debt. We promote **information**
with a twice daily status update of what each pair accomplished. We have a
retrospective **forum** once a week to discuss what is healthy and prompt
self-corrective action.

### Case Study: Research Time

Our team offers a weekly afternoon designed for research. The agreed on **shared
understanding** is research time is for team members to learn more about their
craft. Building projects and prototypes, researching features, reading technical
books, watching conference lectures, and practicing technical skills are all
fair game. However, several people have complained that others are using the
time more for foosball, leaving early, and general messing around.

We had the first and third components: a shared understanding of what's healthy
and a "retrospective" for discussion, but not the information to prompt a
discussion. One way to achieve this might be to have a quick discussion after
the research time where everyone gives a two minute summary of how they spent
the time. Another option would be for each person to write up a brief summary to
a shared chatroom. The healthy pressure of knowing others want to hear what you
learned might alone be enough to curb the instincts to treat the time as
"free-time".

### Summary

> Trust, but verify - Russian Proverb

Self-organizing teams are about unlocking the potential each individual brings
to the team. Being on a self-organizing team is not about freedom from
responsibility. Each team member is still expected to perform their job to the
best of their abilities. 

Building a self-correcting system allows for fewer rule books, fewer meetings,
fewer bottlenecks, and less oversight. All of these contribute to waste,
boredom, and
