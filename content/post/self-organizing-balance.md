I previously discussed how my team has a decade of experience applying
[self-organizing teams](/self-organizing-teams/) and
[pair programming](/pairprogramming/) to reduce wasted productivity in an
Enterprise banking application.

We have several democratically elected practices to help remove obstacles that
stand in the way of producing business value:

+ Full-time pair programming on all production code
+ Any pair can make any technical decision
+ Pairs switch randomly twice a day
+ Strong unit-testing culture
+ Bugs and broken CI builds are the top priority

These foundational practices eliminate the need for a technical lead who assigns
and follows up on work. No work is assigned to any individual. If a pair has
nothing to do, there is a priority queue of features and technical debt close at
hand.

We also eliminate the need for a code review and a pull request process. Any
pair can make any decision, so code review happens 100% of the time.

As amazing as it all sounds, I have recently started to wonder: what prevents
this process from falling into anarchy or no one doing any work? How has this
been working for over ten years with very little oversight? The entire
composition of the teams have completely changed several times over the last ten
years.

I've seen that concept a lot lately as I've read more about healthy
self-organizing teams. Trust should always be given, but a good way to produce
accountability is through openness and "sharing" like that. Recently I've come
to realize that really the practice of stand-ups has a great knock on benefit of
that: pairs aren't assigned work and not really "checked up on", but the sharing
and openness of the stand-up helps give accountability to the group.
