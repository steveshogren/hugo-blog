My team has a decade of experience applying
[self-organizing teams](/self-organizing-teams/) and
[pair-programming](/pairprogramming/) to reduce wasted productivity in an
enterprise banking application.

## The Benefits

### No Technical Lead

Our self-organizing practices eliminate the need for a technical lead who
assigns and follows up on work. No work is assigned to any individual.

### Individual Empowerment

Developers are free to remove pain points as needed, so most have a strong sense
of ownership. Team members feel empowered to champion for broad changes to the
codebase.

### Few Meetings

Without the need for significant process or oversight, the team has very few
meetings a week. In a survey of the last several months, the average team member
had less than **three hours of meetings a week.**

## How does this work?

As amazing as it all sounds, what prevents this process from falling into
anarchy? How has this been working for us for over ten years with very little
oversight? The team has completely changed three times (roughly a 3.6 year
average turnaround) so it can't only be about "the right people".

### Self-Correction While Maintaining Trust

The author of
[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) talks
about the concept of "self-correction" that allows self-organizing teams to
adapt without writing a thick rule-book of policies. Healthy, self-organizing
teams build a **simple system that self-corrects** instead of adding new
policies when trust is abused. Rather than trying to design the perfect
rule-book, they let individuals grow into trusted, intelligent agents who are
expected to learn and improve.

The author suggests that three things are needed for self-correcting teams:

1. **A shared understanding of whatâ€™s healthy**
2. **Information**
3. **A forum for conversation to trigger self-corrective action**

## Our Process

Our process has several examples of self-correction, and several places we are
still sorting out how to best self-correct. We currently apply these
democratically-elected practices:

+ Full-time pair-programming on all production code
+ No work is assigned to any individual or pair
+ Any pair can make any technical decision
+ Pairs are shuffled randomly twice a day
+ Everyone participates in a five-minute status update twice a day
+ Weekly "retrospective" is held to reflect and make changes

### Example: Any pair can make any technical decision

Consider the practice that "any pair can make any technical decision." The
**information** comes when the pairs switch every half-day. Bob and Sally might
think designing the module one way is a good idea in the morning, but Sally and
Jane might see things with a fresh perspective in the afternoon. The information
spreads organically every four hours as a fresh set of eyes gets to see the
work. The **forum for self-corrective action** happens when the new pair
discusses the previous session's decisions.

If a pair makes a technical decision that isn't ideal, the next pair will have
the opportunity to choose to continue down that path or adjust the code to a
better solution. To prevent significant rework, we meet once a week for under an
hour to chat about the upcoming week's features and get a rough idea of the
direction the team wants to go.

In practice, rework happens only occasionally as everyone strives to produce the
best designs they can. No one wants to see their work undone because of a missed
requirement or poor design, which prompts a healthy desire to do one's best.

### Example: Work Isn't Assigned

Work isn't assigned to pairs or individuals. The **shared understanding** is
that the most valuable thing for the business is for pairs to work through the
priority queue of enhancements and technical debt. We promote **information**
with a twice daily status update of what each pair accomplished. We have a
retrospective **forum** once a week to discuss what is healthy and prompt
self-corrective action.

In practice, pairs rarely "go rogue". Only occasionally in the last few years
has it happened, and the issues have been resolved through the weekly
retrospective. A recent example comes from a pair who semi-secretly stayed on an
interesting feature for over a week instead of rotating as agreed. Several other
team-members felt like they'd missed out on getting to build it and brought up
their feelings in the weekly forum. It turned out there was a legitimate benefit
to the pair's decision to stay on the feature for so long. The conclusion was
the pair would've gotten a lot more support if they'd been upfront with the team
with what they saw and their decision to stay on the project for longer than
usual.

> Some simple communication would've saved everyone some hassle

Rather than adding a new policy to the rule-book, the whole team got a reminder
on two great lessons. First, nothing is as simple as it seems. Second, a pinch
of communication prevents a pound of hassle.

### Application (No, you don't need to do pair-programming fulltime!)

Self-correction and self-organization is on a continuum. The more your team
grows to self-correct, the more benefits you gain. 

Not every team should have the same practices for self-correction. Our specific
practices of pair-programming, rotating, and pair-empowerment are not magic:
they are just good examples of applied self-correction. We have found
pair-programming and pair switching to work well for us, but there are infinite
ways to grow a system that self-corrects.

> "Trust, but verify." - Russian proverb

Self-correcting practices allow individuals to perform at their best with fewer
rule books, fewer meetings, fewer bottlenecks, and less oversight. Individuals
are trusted to perform their best, and the team is provided with a way to
discuss improvements. A self-correcting team will find individuals empowered to
improve the business in incredible ways.
