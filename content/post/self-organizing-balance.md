Our chat got me to dig a bit more into the origin of why we started research
time. I found these http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/slack.html and
http://www.jamesshore.com/Articles/Business/Software%20Profitability%20Newsletter/Research%20Time.html

I think his idea of having a "what did you learn" session might be valuable if
we are concerned people are not really using it for research.

I've seen that concept a lot lately as I've read more about healthy
self-organizing teams. Trust should always be given, but a good way to produce
accountability is through openness and "sharing" like that. Recently I've come
to realize that really the practice of stand-ups has a great knock on benefit of
that: pairs aren't assigned work and not really "checked up on", but the sharing
and openness of the stand-up helps give accountability to the group.
