My team has a decade of experience applying
[self-organizing teams](/self-organizing-teams/) and
[pair-programming](/pairprogramming/) to reduce wasted productivity in an
enterprise banking application.

We currently apply several democratically-elected practices to improve
our performance:

+ Full-time pair-programming on all production code
+ No work is assigned to any individual or pair
+ Any pair can make any technical decision
+ Pairs are shuffled randomly twice a day
+ Five-minute status update twice a day
+ Weekly "retrospective" to reflect and make changes

## The Benefits

### No Technical Lead

These foundational practices eliminate the need for a technical lead who assigns
and follows up on work. No work is assigned to any individual. If a pair has
nothing to do, there is a priority queue of features and technical debt close at
hand.

If a pair makes a technical decision that isn't ideal, the next pair will have
the opportunity to choose to continue down that path or adjust the code to a
better solution. To prevent significant rework, we meet once a week for under an
hour to chat about the upcoming week's features and get a rough idea of the
direction the team wants to go.

### No Pull Requests

Pairing and pair rotation eliminates the need for an asynchronous code review
and a pull request process. Any pair can make any decision, so code review
happens 100% of the time. A single feature is usually seen by three to five
developers as they rotate through the pairs.

### Few Meetings

Without the need for significant oversight, the team has very few meetings a
week. In a survey of the last several months, the average team member had less
than **three hours of meetings a week.**

## How does this work?

As amazing as it all sounds, what prevents this process from falling into
anarchy? How has this been working for us for over ten years with very little
oversight? The team has completely changed three times (roughly a 3.6 year
average turnaround) so it can't only be about "the right people".

### Self-Correction While Maintaining Trust

The author of
[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) talks
about "self-correction" that allows self-organizing teams to adapt without
putting a thick rule-book of policies into place and revoking trust. Policies
slow down organizations as they add additional cognitive overhead and a
maintenance burden. Instead of adding new policies when trust is abused, these
organizations build a simple system that self-corrects. Rather than trying to
design the perfect rule-book, let individuals grow into trusted, intelligent
agents who learn and adapt.

The author suggests that three things are needed for self-correcting teams:

1. A shared understanding of whatâ€™s healthy
2. Information
3. A forum for conversation to trigger self-corrective action

Our process has several examples of self-correction, and several places we are
still sorting out how to best self-correct.

### Example: Any pair can make any technical decision

Consider the practice that "any pair can make any technical decision." The
**information** comes when the pairs switch every half-day. Zack and Sally might
think architecting the module one way is a good idea in the morning, but Sally
and Jane might see things with a fresh perspective in the afternoon. The
information spreads organically every four hours as a fresh set of eyes gets to
see the work. The **forum for self-corrective action** happens when the new pair
discusses the previous session's decisions.

In practice, rework happens only occasionally as everyone strives to produce the
best designs they can. No one wants to see their work undone because of a missed
requirement or poor design, which prompts a healthy desire to do one's best.

### Example: Work Isn't Assigned

Work isn't assigned to pairs or individuals. The **shared understanding** is
that the most valuable thing for the business is for pairs to work through the
priority queue of enhancements and technical debt. We promote **information**
with a twice daily status update of what each pair accomplished. We have a
retrospective **forum** once a week to discuss what is healthy and prompt
self-corrective action.

In practice, pairs rarely "go rogue". Only occasionally in the last few years
has it happened, and the issue often resolves itself through the weekly
retrospective. A recent example comes from a pair who semi-secretly stayed on an
interesting feature for over a week. Several other team-members felt like they'd
missed out and brought up their feelings in the weekly forum. It turned out
there was a legitimate benefit to the pair's decision to stay on the feature for
so long. The conclusion was the pair would've gotten a lot more support if
they'd been upfront with the team with what they saw and their decision to stay
on the project for longer than usual.

> Some simple communication would've saved everyone some hassle

Rather than adding a new policy to the rule-book, the whole team got a reminder
on two great lessons. First, nothing is as simple as it seems. Second, a pinch
of communication prevents a pound of hassle.

### Summary

Self-organization is not about freedom from responsibility. Self-organizing
teams unlock the potential each individual brings to the team. Each team member
is expected to perform their job to the best of their abilities, but now has
fewer distractions and waste.

A self-correcting system allows for fewer rule books, fewer meetings, fewer
bottlenecks, and less oversight. Teams are freed to better meet the needs of the
business.
