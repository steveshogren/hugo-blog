*In this series I practice reading whitepapers by following a modified set of
steps outlined in the guide: [How to read and understand a scientific paper: a guide for non-scientists](https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/08/25/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-2/)*

[The Byzantine Generals Problem pdf](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-749/READINGS/required/resilience/lamport82.pdf)

* **Begin by reading the introduction, not the abstract.**

    The introduction explains the broad problem of how to create a network of
    components where any number of nodes in the network may be sending
    conflicting and false information to the other nodes.

* **Identify the BIG QUESTION.**

    The BIG QUESTION is: **how to create a network of nodes that decides on a
    common plan of action when some nodes are sending false information.**
    
    The big question is posed abstractly as: how can many generals decide on a
    plan when some generals are traitors sending false information and all
    generals can only communicate via messages to each other.
    
* **Identify the SPECIFIC QUESTION(S)**

    The SPECIFIC QUESTION is more simple: **ensure a single "general node" is able
    to send an order for all loyal "lieutenant nodes" to follow, and all lieutenant
    nodes follow the order if the general is loyal.**
    
    These two conditions are called the _interactive consistency_ conditions.
    
    Solving this specific question will unlock the solution to the more
    complicated scenario with multiple nodes all communicating with each other.

* **Determine Outline**
    1. Abstract
    1. Introduction
    1. Problem definition with forgeable (unsigned) messages
    1. Proof with forgeable (unsigned) messages
    1. Proof with unforgeable (signed) messages
    1. Proof for an incomplete graph with forgeable (unsigned) messages
    1. Proof for an incomplete graph with unforgeable (signed) messages
    1. The application of the previous proofs to build reliable systems that
       calculate solutions across multiple processors
    1. Conclusion

* **Identify the approach**

    The approach is a set of logical, inductive proofs.

* **Explain any diagrams/charts**

    Fig 1 and Fig 2 illustrate how it is impossible for one commander and two
    lieutenants to come to consensus with unsigned messages when one of the
    three is a traitor.

    Fig 3 and Fig 4 show the oral (unsigned) communication paths of one
    commander and three lieutenants, represented by OM(1). Fig 3 shows the paths
    of a traitorous lieutenant, and how the other lieutenants can simply do
    whatever the majority of inputs recommend. Fig 4 shows the traitorous
    commander, and how all three lieutenants need to fall back to their default
    behavior, as there is no clear winning majority.

    Fig 5 illustrates passing signed messages with one commander and two
    lieutenants, represented by SM(1). Each message gets appended to the end, so
    a traitorous commander is revealed by sending different messages to each
    lieutenant.

* **Explain the recommended solution/algorithm/theory/proofs**
    
    1. Inductive proof with forgeable (unsigned) messages - requires 3m+1 generals
       where *m* is the traitor general count
       
       They use a proof by contradiction to prove that therefore no solution
       exists for fewer than 3m+1 generals.

    1. Inductive proof with unforgeable (signed) messages - requires only m+2
       generals where *m* is the traitor general count
    1. Proof for an incomplete graph with forgeable (unsigned) messages -
       requires at least 3m+1 generals where *m* is the count of traitors and
       each general on the graph has 3m connections. (aka
       [3m-regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_graph)). Therefore a
       3m+1 network must be completely connected.
    1. Proof for an incomplete graph with unforgeable (signed) messages -
       requires at least m+d-1 generals where *m* is the count of traitors and
       *d* is the
       [graph diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory))
       (longest shortest distance between two generals)

* **FINAL STEP: (Donâ€™t neglect doing this) What do other researchers say about this paper?**
