When choosing an editor or IDE, the most value comes from learning it well. A
master can still make great work with any tool.

A few years ago, I decided to learn one editor really well. To that point, I had
worked mostly in Perl, PHP, and Java. I was also tinkering with Ruby. I wanted
something that could handle Perl, PHP, and Ruby well, and possibly even support
Java.

I decided to try Emacs entirely on the recommendation of my mentor. He could
make everything fly in Emacs. His fingers would dance over the keyboard while
text flashed about the screen. It was a sight to behold, and I wanted that
magic.


I work regularly in the following languages:

* Clojure
* Haskell
* Javascript
* F#
* Racket
