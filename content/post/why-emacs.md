When choosing an editor or IDE, the most value comes from learning it well. A
master can still make great work with any tool.

A few years ago, I decided to learn one editor really well. To that point, I had
worked mostly in Perl, PHP, and Java. I was also tinkering with Ruby. I wanted
something that could handle Perl, PHP, and Ruby well, and possibly even support
Java.

I decided to try Emacs entirely on the recommendation of my mentor. He could
make everything fly in Emacs. His fingers would dance over the keyboard while
text flashed about the screen. It was a sight to behold, and I wanted that
magic.

After a few years of heavy Emacs usage, I started to get pinky finger numbness
and tingling. To help with this situation, I picked up the Vim editing system
inside Emacs, aptly named Vimpulse. Pinky numbness went away!

Meanwhile, I moved from mostly Perl to entirely PHP. Then from PHP to Python,
then from Python to Clojure and Scheme. While Emacs has fine support for all of
these, it doesn't have the same features of a big box IDE like Intellij or
Visual Studio.

This isn't to say it is better or worse, just a different feature set. I still
use Intellij exclusively for Java and Android development and Visual Studio at
work, where I wrangle a large C# codebase.

Emacs has many good plugins for different languages. Many, like the plugins for
Haskell and Clojure, offer full suites of refactoring, auto-complete, build
errors, and navigation. These plugins are fine, but often they come with a
mental price for new shortcuts and workflows. Each new plugin has slightly
different features and shortcuts. Over time, I have become less and less
enamored with these plugins.

A respected coworker said it best:

> I think I am as fast with basic Vim editing as most people are with Resharper

I have found that when learned well, Emacs has decent altern

I regularly work on the train, where it is difficult to use a mouse. I also
cannot always easily move my arms around for reaching the trackpad or arrow
keys.
