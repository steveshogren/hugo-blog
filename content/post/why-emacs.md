When choosing an editor or IDE, the most value comes from learning it well. A
master never blames their tools.

My Preferences:
* Great cross-language support
* Mouse-free
* Stable tools that work in every language
* Customizable

What I don't need:
* Already installed on every system
* Easy to install
* Excellent tooling for a single language

Since my goals 

An IDE is a "T-shaped" editor. The IDE provides an amazing experience for one or
two languages, and an average or poor experience in everything else. By default
Visual Studio and Intellij IDEA offer phenomenal support for C# and Java. They
both have plugins that decently support other languages like SQL, JavaScript,
HTML, etc. Support falls off for C, Scheme, Rust, etc.
