Vim is a complex and powerful tool for serious professionals. Most professional
tools have a steep learning curve.

If you ever talk to a professional cyclist about bikes, you'll quickly realize
their equipment is totally different from the basic $100 bike and $10 pump.
While similar in form and function, the professional cyclist has much more
complex equipment.

Vim is no different! Vim is complex, powerful, professional-grade equipment.
Most basic text editors come equipped with cut, copy, paste, arrow keys, and
find/replace. Vim also comes with dozens of extra commands. If you are serious
about speed and efficiency, Vim and Vim plugins offer some of the most
composable commands with the least keystrokes. Powerful commands easily compose
into larger edits, and larger edits compose into persistent and repeatable
macros.

All this power comes with a price: steep learning curve. To fully master Vim,
you must put in the time. You must build up muscle memory, and muscle memory
requires repeated practice. 

To help with this, I am writing a set of practice material for building up
muscle memory in Vim. It contains a bunch of files that can be used to practice
each command. I'll start to post up different sections here for free.
