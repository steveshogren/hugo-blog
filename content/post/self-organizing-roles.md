My team has a decade of experience applying
[self-organizing teams](/self-organizing-teams/) and
[pair-programming](/pairprogramming/) to reduce wasted productivity in an
enterprise banking application.


Self-correction and self-organization is on a continuum. For example, our
developers are not expected to decide what features to work on next. Our team of
business experts and analysts think up and prioritize new strategic initiatives.
The domain is so complex and our customers are so huge that it would be
unreasonable to expect a developer to do as good as a job as our industry
experts. While they do take advice from developers and QA staff, ultimately we
all agree that role is filled best by someone focusing on it full-time. Since
the teams can be fluid, several people have rotated from development to QA to
business. 

Similarly, while our development staff writes and maintains a huge number of
automated tests, our QA staff has a whole second set that they maintain with the
business experts. While we all are trusted and allowed to rotate and learn a new
role, we all agree having the three roles separate allows us to compartmentalize
and focus.
