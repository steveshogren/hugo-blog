A self organizing team can be one of the most effective ways to build a team of
high quality professionals. It can also be one of the most inefficient
structures ever devised.

## What Is A Self-Organizing Team?

I have managed several self-organizing teams of developers over the last few
years. They are expected to follow these tenets:

+ The whole team organizes themselves to best meet the business needs
+ Each team chooses their practices and working agreements
+ All technical and organizational decisions are driven through consensus
+ Product owners determine "what" happens, the team determines "how"
+ All staff participates in a culture of high quality development
+ Systems and practices are designed to maintain greatest productivity across
  the next decade

## When It Works Well

+ Small teams
+ Highly skilled (RE: expensive) workers
+ Need for high quality software
+ Business need for continuous and stable productivity for 5+ years
+ Buy-in from management that "productivity is worth feeling out of control"

Self organizing teams work exceptionally well with small groups of highly driven
developers. It fits best when most people on your team are chomping at the bit
to do more, be more, and learn more. These "self-actualized" developers will
find a single leader to be a bottleneck, and it will impair their abilities to
grow.

> The most important way to build such a team is to allow them to fail.

Every time someone with "role-power" comes and demands the team do something
different, it reduces the intrinsic motivation of the team.

## Case Study

I currently lead such a team. In any other company, our least experienced
developers would be team leads and architects; and our most experienced
developers would be leading organizations. They've gotten this experience by
living it. Each member of our teams is responsible for "being the lead" in
certain ways. Their own interests guide them to become experts across a wide
variety of subjects. By being an expert, others listen to them, so they often
have a wide audience when speaking on their specialties.

We share in the work of designing security, authentication, query performance,
ORM's, system design, UI technologies, language paradigms, installers, run time
characteristics, "pop culture architecture", CI build systems, configuration
tooling, over two dozen business modules, and roughly 700KLOC per developer. No
single person is a point of failure or bottleneck for these subjects, instead
each developer has specialized in a few. If any one person leaves, a few others
have enough knowledge to fill in any gaps while learning more.


## When It Is Less Effective

+ Large, distributed teams
+ Business requires short term productivity at any cost to long term
  productivity
+ Management that wants to be able to control the situation
