Robert Kegan's model of adult development will change how you think about
software development.

Thesis ideas:

- the model explains the best parts of XP
- the model is a goal to strive for as an individual
- the model is just interesting
- it recommends how to best design a process

In his model, humans move through six stages of development.

The six stages are as follows:

* Incorporative 
 - (learning basics of tools)

* Impulsive 
 - needs to be told what to do
 - stopped from making mess
 - "I am my impulses, perceptions"

* Imperial 
 - short-term
 - transactional alliances
 - follow rules to not get punished
 - "I am my needs/goals"

* Intra-personal | Communal | Socialized 
 - symmetrical relationships
 - external beliefs followed because external pressure
 - external validation
 - "I am relationships, I follow the rules because it is what others expect"

* Institutional | Systemic | Self-Authoring
 - asymmetrical formal relationships
 - "I define myself" 
 - "I am authorship, identities, ideologies"
 - "I am identified by what I do" 
 - "I choose what to do" 
 - "I follow the rules because I see they are good to follow"
 - "I have relationships"
 - Commitment to ideas/beliefs

* Inter-individual | Interconnected | Fluid
 - "I question authority and myself"
 - limited identity
 - "I have authorship, identities, ideologies"
 - multiple value systems

A person can follow an action without understanding why they do it.
Understanding is not required for compliance. However, humans learn almost
everything by mimicking modeled behaviors until they understand why.

Self-authoring is no exception. 

Following an action doesn't mean you understand why you do it.

Any process that causes a reflection and changes to process inherently is going
to stretch a person into more Self-Authoring mindsets.
