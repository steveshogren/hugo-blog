A few weeks back, a team in my group decided to adopt ClojureScript for a new
project. The lead on the project was a little green with Clojure, and so he
requested my help to lay the foundation for the project. He wanted to use
Angular2, and be able to inter-op with existing Angular directives.

The first day, he wanted to try getting it working while pairing with another
developer who knows no Clojure or JavaScript. The two of them grew frustrated
throughout the day, as they struggled with the basics of lein, lisp syntax, and
JavaScript inter-op.
